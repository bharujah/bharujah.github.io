Hey Shamphavi,,,, This is a warning for you,, 
You should spend time with me!!!

ðŸš¨ Warning: 
Prolonged absence from spending time with me may result in severe cases of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and increased levels of loneliness! ðŸš¨

Symptoms may include uncontrollable laughter, spontaneous dance parties, and a sudden urge to binge-watch our favorite shows together. ðŸ˜„

Proceed with caution and consider this your official invitation to hang out and make me feel like the happiest person alive! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸš¨ Attention: Extended periods of not hanging out with me may lead to a condition known as 'Friendship Deficit Disorder' (FDD). ðŸš¨

Symptoms of FDD may include:

- Excessive sighing whenever seeing a meme you'd love.
- An inexplicable craving for our secret handshake.
- Uncontrollable laughter at inside jokes, even when no one's around to share them.
- A sudden drop in energy levels, also known as the 'No-Friend Blues'.

ðŸš« Side effects of FDD may also include an increased risk of boredom, loneliness, and an unexplained urge to text me funny GIFs at odd hours. ðŸš«

In case of emergency (read: extreme boredom), break glass by calling me for an instant mood boost and guaranteed fun time! ðŸŽ‰

Remember, friendship maintenance is essential for your mental health and well-being. Let's hang out soon and keep those FDD levels in check! ðŸ˜„
